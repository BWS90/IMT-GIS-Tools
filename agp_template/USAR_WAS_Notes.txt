USAR Wide Area Search (WAS) GDB

Examined ability to use in same manner as Event GDB from wildland community.

Works well after symbolizing and creating feature templates.

Remember to enter any universal defaults while in the feature template step.

Remember to change the projection: WGS1984 Projected UTM seems the way to go (I think Houston is zone 14)

Apparently FEMA USAR teams are taught this vanilla version.  I think we could add some other point/line/poly features
such as Fireline, Collapse Zone, Hot/Cold Zones, etc.  But we should create new feature sets for those so that when
dealing with USAR assets these feature sets will be familiar and a common language.  Also their handheld GPS units
are setup to capture these defined symbols.

***Changes***

*Disassociated the domain "WAS_TF_List" left it in the GDB but now the team name should be defined when we're entering
the other default values like Incident_Name and team_squad.  This was done since the domain was limited to FEMA
approved USAR Task Forces.  Now we can add local asset names.

*Added an Incident_Name field

*Added an Incident_ID Field - this could be a FDID or box number back in NYC

*Added an IMT_Name Field

*Added tracking fields to both WAS Points and Progression

*Enabled tracking on both WAS Points and Progression - not sure if this will stay on so we should check when establishing
a new GDB


***Known Problems***

*Currently the x/y coordinate fields are not self populating.  You can ask them to calculate and they will, but if 
you add a new feature it comes up <null>  - I'd like to make this automatic if possible
