The National SAR Geospatial Coordination Group (NSARGC) Cadre continues to develop this ArcGIS Pro Template. 
This folder structure is based on the National Wildfire Coordination Group PMS936 standard.

See the projects folder to get started with the ArcGIS Pro Project. The layouts are currently pointing
to the Sandbox ArcGIS Pro Web Map but the FEMA ArcGIS Pro Web Map is also embedded in the project
and ready for use. You will simply need to change the data frame the layouts point to. We will add additional documentation soon.
